### Project 1. Consumer Complaint Analysis

- Systematically structured and analyzed data to discern trends in Consumer Complaints over time. Uncovered a notable statistical spike in the number of complaints during certain days in 2017, warranting further investigation.
- Leveraged Matplotlib and Seaborn Libraries to craft visually compelling representations, employing various types of charts to effectively communicate the findings.
